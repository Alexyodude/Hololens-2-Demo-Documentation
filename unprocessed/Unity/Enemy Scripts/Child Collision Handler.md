### Summary

The `ChildCollisionHandler` is an effective way to handle collisions for parts of a composite object (like an enemy) where individual components may not need to process collisions independently, but rather report them to a central handler. This setup simplifies the management of complex interactions by encapsulating collision handling logic within the parent object, reducing redundancy and maintaining cleaner code architecture.

## `ChildCollisionHandler` Class Explanation

### Overview

The `ChildCollisionHandler` script is used to detect collisions on child components of an enemy object and pass these collision events up to a parent handler object, specifically an `EnemyCollisionHandler`. This approach is common in game development where a complex object like an enemy has multiple collidable child components that need centralized handling.

### Namespace

```C#
using UnityEngine;
```

- **`UnityEngine`**: Provides classes and methods necessary for scripting in Unity, including components, game objects, and system events like collisions.

### Class Definition

```C#
public class ChildCollisionHandler : MonoBehaviour
```

- **`public class ChildCollisionHandler`**: Declares a public class named `ChildCollisionHandler`.
- **`: MonoBehaviour`**: Indicates that `ChildCollisionHandler` inherits from `MonoBehaviour`, allowing it to be attached to GameObjects and utilize Unity's event system.

### Fields

- **`private EnemyCollisionHandler parentHandler;`**: A private field that stores a reference to the `EnemyCollisionHandler`. This reference is used to pass collision information from the child to the parent.

### Methods

#### `Start` Method

```C#
void Start()
{
    // Get the parent handler
    parentHandler = GetComponentInParent<EnemyCollisionHandler>();
}
```

- **Purpose**: Called before the first frame update, this method initializes the `parentHandler` by finding the `EnemyCollisionHandler` component on the parent GameObject. This setup ensures that any collision on the child is managed by a centralized handler on the parent.

#### `OnCollisionEnter` Method

```C#
void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision)
{
    // Relay the collision to the parent handler
    if (parentHandler != null)
    {
        parentHandler.HandleChildCollision(collision);
    }
}
```

- **Purpose**: Automatically called by Unity when the GameObject this script is attached to collides with another GameObject.
- **Functionality**:
    - **Relaying Collision**: If `parentHandler` is not null (i.e., it has been successfully linked in `Start`), the collision event is forwarded to the parent handler via the `HandleChildCollision` method. This allows for centralized processing of collisions at the parent level, maintaining consistency in how collisions are handled and possibly aggregating collision data or responses, such as playing a sound, changing health, or triggering animations.
