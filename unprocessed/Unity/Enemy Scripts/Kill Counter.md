### Summary

- **Kill Counter UI**: The `KillCounter` class is designed to update a UI text element in real-time to display the number of enemies killed, as tracked by another script (`ToggleEnemy`).
    
- **Dynamic Text Update**: By leveraging the `TextMeshProUGUI` component and Unity's `Update` method, the script ensures that the displayed kill count is always accurate and up-to-date.
    
- **Integration with `ToggleEnemy`**: This script relies on the `ToggleEnemy` class to retrieve the kill count, demonstrating how different components and scripts in Unity can interact with each other to manage game state and UI updates.

## `KillCounter` Class Explanation

### Namespaces

```C#
using UnityEngine;
using TMPro;
```

- **`using UnityEngine;`**: Imports the `UnityEngine` namespace, which provides access to Unity's core classes and functionalities.
- **`using TMPro;`**: Imports the `TMPro` namespace, which is required for working with TextMeshPro, Unity's advanced text rendering system.

### Class Definition

```csharp
public class KillCounter : MonoBehaviour
```

- **`public class KillCounter`**: Defines a class named `KillCounter`.
- **`: MonoBehaviour`**: Inherits from `MonoBehaviour`, allowing this class to be attached to Unity GameObjects and to utilize Unity's lifecycle methods like `Start` and `Update`.

### Variables

- **`private ToggleEnemy enemyManager;`**: A private variable that holds a reference to the `ToggleEnemy` class. This class is assumed to be managing enemy-related logic, including keeping track of the kill count.
    
    - **`private`**: The variable is private, meaning it is only accessible within the `KillCounter` class.
        
    - **`ToggleEnemy`**: The type of the variable, which is a reference to another script that presumably manages enemies and their associated data, such as kill count.
        

### `Start` Method

```C#
void Start()
{
    // Find the Enemy script that manages the list
    enemyManager = FindObjectOfType<ToggleEnemy>();
}
```

- **Purpose**: The `Start` method is called once when the script is first activated. It initializes the reference to the `ToggleEnemy` script.
    
- **Finding the `ToggleEnemy` Script**:
    
    - **`enemyManager = FindObjectOfType<ToggleEnemy>();`**: This line of code searches the scene for a `ToggleEnemy` component and assigns it to the `enemyManager` variable. `FindObjectOfType` is a Unity method that returns the first active loaded object of the specified type it finds in the scene.

### `Update` Method

```C#
void Update()
{
    // Update the kill count text
    GetComponent<TextMeshProUGUI>().text = $"Kills: {enemyManager.getKillCount}";
}
```

- **Purpose**: The `Update` method is called once per frame. It continuously updates the displayed text to reflect the current kill count.
    
- **Updating the Text**:
    
    - **`GetComponent<TextMeshProUGUI>().text = $"Kills: {enemyManager.getKillCount}";`**: This line retrieves the `TextMeshProUGUI` component attached to the same GameObject as this script and updates its `text` property to display the current kill count. The kill count is fetched from the `getKillCount` property of the `ToggleEnemy` script.
        
        - **`GetComponent<TextMeshProUGUI>()`**: Retrieves the `TextMeshProUGUI` component attached to the GameObject. This component is responsible for rendering the text in the UI.
            
        - **`text`**: The property of `TextMeshProUGUI` that sets the string displayed by the text element.
            
        - **`$"Kills: {enemyManager.getKillCount}"`**: A C# interpolated string that constructs the text to be displayed. It shows the word "Kills:" followed by the current value of `getKillCount` from the `ToggleEnemy` script.
