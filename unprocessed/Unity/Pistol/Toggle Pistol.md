In unity the name of the UI button is toggle pistol and the script attached is called ToggleGun.
### Summary

- **Gun Instantiation and Destruction**: The `ToggleGun` class provides simple functionality to instantiate a gun when needed (`OnGun`) and destroy it when no longer required (`OffGun`).
- **Flexible Usage**: This class can be easily attached to any GameObject in Unity, making it versatile for various scenarios, such as enabling and disabling weapons in a game.
- **Prefab Handling**: The class uses prefabs, which are templates for GameObjects, allowing for efficient reuse and consistent instantiation.
## `ToggleGun` Class Explanation

### Namespaces

- **`using UnityEngine;`**: Provides access to Unity's core classes and functionalities, enabling the script to interact with GameObjects and manage their lifecycle.

### Class Definition

```C#
public class ToggleGun : MonoBehaviour
```

- **`public class ToggleGun`**: Defines a class named `ToggleGun`.
- **`: MonoBehaviour`**: Inherits from `MonoBehaviour`, allowing this class to be attached to Unity GameObjects and to utilize Unity's lifecycle methods such as `Start` and `Update`.

### Variables

- **`public GameObject GunPrefab;`**: A public variable that stores a reference to the gun prefab. This prefab is the model or object that will be instantiated in the scene when the gun is "turned on."
- **`private GameObject Gun;`**: A private variable to hold a reference to the instantiated gun object. This allows the script to keep track of the gun instance for later manipulation or destruction.

### `OnGun` Method

```C#
public void OnGun()
{
    Gun = Instantiate(GunPrefab, transform.position, Quaternion.identity);
}
```

- **Purpose**: The `OnGun` method is responsible for "turning on" the gun by creating (instantiating) it in the scene.
    
- **Instantiation**:
    
    - **`Instantiate(GunPrefab, transform.position, Quaternion.identity);`**: This line creates a new instance of the `GunPrefab` at the current position of the GameObject to which this script is attached. The rotation is set to `Quaternion.identity`, meaning the gun will have no initial rotation (aligned with the world axes).
- **Reference Storage**:
    
    - The newly created gun instance is stored in the `Gun` variable. This allows the script to reference this specific instance later, particularly for destroying it when "turning off" the gun.

### `OffGun` Method

```C#
public void OffGun()
{
    Destroy(Gun);
}
```

- **Purpose**: The `OffGun` method "turns off" the gun by destroying the previously instantiated gun object.
    
- **Destruction**:
    
    - **`Destroy(Gun);`**: This line removes the gun instance from the scene. If the gun is currently active (i.e., it has been instantiated by the `OnGun` method), this will delete it and free up the associated resources.
- **Null Handling**:
    
    - The script does not explicitly handle cases where `Gun` might be `null` (e.g., if `OffGun` is called before `OnGun`). If `Gun` is `null`, the `Destroy` method will simply have no effect.
