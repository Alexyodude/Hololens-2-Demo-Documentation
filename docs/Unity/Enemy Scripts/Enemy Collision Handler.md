### Summary

The `EnemyCollisionHandler` class provides a robust mechanism for detecting and handling critical collisions for enemy characters. By delegating collision handling to this dedicated class, the game can maintain clean separation of concerns where enemy logic is centralized, enhancing maintainability and scalability of the game code.

## `EnemyCollisionHandler` Class Explanation

### Namespace

```C#
using UnityEngine;
```

- **`UnityEngine`**: Provides classes and methods necessary for scripting in Unity, encompassing a broad range of functionalities like game objects, components, and collision handling.

### Class Definition

```C#
public class EnemyCollisionHandler : MonoBehaviour
```

- **`public class EnemyCollisionHandler`**: Declares a public class named `EnemyCollisionHandler`.
- **`: MonoBehaviour`**: Inherits from `MonoBehaviour`, enabling this class to be attached to Unity GameObjects and use Unity's event-driven methods such as `Start` and collision events.

### Fields

- **`private ToggleEnemy enemyManager;`**: A private field storing a reference to the `ToggleEnemy` class, which is responsible for overall enemy management within the game, including tracking the number of enemies killed and managing their states.

### Methods

#### `Start` Method

```C#
void Start()
{
    // Find the Enemy script that manages the list
    enemyManager = FindObjectOfType<ToggleEnemy>();
}
```

- **Purpose**: Initializes the `enemyManager` by finding an active instance of the `ToggleEnemy` component somewhere within the scene. This approach assumes that there is only one `ToggleEnemy` manager active at any time, which centralizes enemy control.

#### `HandleChildCollision` Method

```C#
public void HandleChildCollision(Collision collision)
{
    // Check if the collided object has the tag "Destroy"
    if (collision.gameObject.CompareTag("Destroy") && gameObject.GetComponent<EnemyState>().isAlive)
    {
        gameObject.GetComponent<EnemyState>().isAlive = false;
        enemyManager.EnterRagdollState(gameObject);
        enemyManager.EnemyKilled();
    }
}
```

- **Purpose**: Handles collisions reported by child components of the enemy GameObject. It specifically responds to collisions with objects tagged as "Destroy", indicating a collision that should result in the enemy's defeat or destruction.
    
- **Functionality**:
    
    - **Collision Check**: First, it confirms if the colliding object is tagged with "Destroy" and checks if the enemy is currently alive using a `isAlive` flag from the `EnemyState` component.
    - **State Update**: If the conditions are met, it sets the `isAlive` flag to `false`, indicating the enemy is no longer alive.
    - **Ragdoll Transition**: Calls `EnterRagdollState` on the `enemyManager` to transition the enemy's state visually and physically to a ragdoll, enhancing the realism of the impact.
    - **Count Update**: Invokes `EnemyKilled` on the `enemyManager` to increment the count of enemies killed, which could potentially trigger game logic such as updating scores or progressing game stages.
