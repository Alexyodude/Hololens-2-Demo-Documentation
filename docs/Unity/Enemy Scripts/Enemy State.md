### Summary

The `EnemyState` class serves as a minimalistic approach to managing the life status of enemies in a game. By toggling the `isAlive` property, other scripts can check this status to make decisions or trigger events, such as disabling enemy AI, playing a death animation, or removing the enemy from the game. This class acts as a flag for the enemy's state without implementing detailed logic itself.
